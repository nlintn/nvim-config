# nvim-config

My nixified Neovim config: based of [kickstart-nix.nvim](https://github.com/nix-community/kickstart-nix.nvim), but tailored to myself - and inspired by [nvim.nix](https://github.com/iofq/nvim.nix)'s ability to bundle the whole config as an AppImage.

On systems with the nix package manager, you can easily try out my config (all dependencies included!) the following way:
```
nix run "github:nlintn/nvim-config"
```
